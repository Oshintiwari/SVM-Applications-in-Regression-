# SVM Applications in Regression

## Overview
Applied Support Vector Regression (SVR) with various kernels to predict non-linear patterns in Kaggle datasets. Addressed underfitting issues and optimized performance.

## Key Features
- Implemented SVR with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels.
- Feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Scikit-learn
- Python (NumPy, Pandas)

## Results
- Achieved accurate salary predictions with non-linear kernels.

Steps to Run:

1. Install Python and required libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
   
2. Clone the GitHub repository from the provided link and navigate into the project directory.
   
3. Add the Kaggle dataset (containing columns such as YearsExperience and Salary) to the project directory.
   
4. Execute the main Python script in the repository to train and evaluate the SVM regression models.
   
5. Analyze the printed metrics and review the generated scatter plots comparing the actual vs. predicted values.
